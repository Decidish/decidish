# ​​​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍Project Requirements Documentation

## 1. Motivation & Problem Statement

The users encounter a variety of difficulties that are related to meal planning, shopping, and cooking.

### 1.1. Time, Energy, and Money Costs

Decision Fatigue: Time and energy for deciding what to cook or finding the right recipes are missing in many people.

Result: Usually, such exhaustion ends up in money being spent on ordering food to be delivered or eating out, which is both more expensive and less healthy, most of the time.

### 1.2. Deficiency of Recipe Personalization

Internet is overflowing with non-personalized recipes that do not consider the individual user but just make content that is generic.

Personal Factors: There are hardly any recipes that take into account the user's budget, taste, or dietary restrictions (e.g., an allergy) side of the equation.

Regional Availability: The reason might be that recipes are suggesting ingredients which could be either not easily available or too expensive in the user's particular country or city.

### 1.3. Health & Dietary Monotony

Repetitive Meals: Inspired by a lack of time or motivation, users usually come back to the same simple meals (e.g., "always pasta") that they already know.

Nutritional Imbalance: By doing so, very often the diet lacks balance and the person misses the chance to discover new food.

### 1.4. Food, Time, and Resource Waste

Food Spoilage: Users are guilty of food wasting (e.g., vegetables, fruits, bread that is left behind), mainly because they do not know what they have at home, and as a result, these things go bad and get moldy.

Inefficient Shopping: Making a shopping list is a time-intensive job. Many users do not realize that they already have some ingredients at home, which leads them to double buying or forgetting things.

Value Unclear: Users do not have the clear view to evaluate the cost-benefit of planning against the waste (time, food, money) of not planning.

## 2. Project Goal

Project goal is to build a meal planner and shopping list creator that is not only personalized but also time-saving and budget-friendly, the tool helps users to discover recipes, minimize food waste, and facilitate their shopping.

## 3. Proposed Features & User Flow (Mock-up)

### 3.1. Landing Page & Onboarding

Welcome: A simple landing page explaining the service.

Localization (Optional): In order to provide the user with locally available ingredients, users give a postal code (e.g. "market selection").

Personalization Quiz: The user goes through a series of questions that help to build their profile, these include:

Budget (how much to spend)

Frequency (how often they cook)

Dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, low-carb)

Allergies

Other relevant preferences.

### 3.2. Recipe Selection

Set Timeframe: The user can choose the time for which they want to plan (e.g. a day, 2 days, a week).

Swiping-style Interface: Several recipes that fit the user's profile are shown to the user, and the user can swipe (e.g., "like" or "dislike") to indicate their choice of recipes for the plan.

### 3.3. Shopping List Management

Creation: The user can create a combined shopping list from the choices of recipes.

Modification: A user is allowed to make changes in the shopping list (e.g., take away the things that they already have, add other stuff from the house).

Sharing: The user can share the shopping list with a notes app or other formats.

Online Purchase (Future Scope): There will be an option for the user to purchase the items on the list directly from an online grocery ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌service.
